# AutonomousGIS_GeodataRetrieverAgent
AutonomousGIS_GeodataRetrieverAgent is a plugin integration of an autonmomous agent for geospatial data retrieval and QGIS. This plugin simplifies the process of retrieving and loading geospatial data into the QGIS environment through natural language commands. It leverages [LLM-Find](https://github.com/gladcolor/LLM-Find), an autonomous framework designed to select and fetch geospatial data by generating and executing programs with self-debugging capabilities. For more details on the frame work, please refer to the [LLM-Find](https://github.com/gladcolor/LLM-Find) and our manuscript: Huan Ning, Zhenlong Li, Temitope Akinboyewa, and M. Naser Lessani. 2024. “LLM-Find: An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval.” arXiv. [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.21024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.21024).
