# MacOS users
## After the installation of the plugin, you need to install the "nest_asyncio" manually. Follow the steps below:
- Open the QGIS Python Console by navigating to ```Plugins``` > ```Python Console``` or press ```Ctrl+Alt+P```
- In the console, run these two lines of code:
  ```python
  import pip
  pip.main(['install', 'nest-asyncio'])
- If you encounter any issue you can also try installing "nest_asyncio" via the terminal by pointing to QGIS python interpreter:
  
  ```python
  /Applications/QGIS3.38.1.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/python3 -m pip install nest_asyncio

# How to Use the Plugin
- The plugin interface consists of three tabs - ```Data Request Page```, ```Settings```, and ```Help```
- Data requests are made in the ```Data Request Page```. This consists of the ```Code pad``` which displays the AI-generated codes, ```Information Panel``` which displays the agent running information, ```Data request message panel``` which enables the user to enter the resuest message in natural language command, and the ```Output dirctory``` which enables user to set the desired path to save the downloaded data.

![Plugin Interface.png](Docs%2FPlugin%20Interface.png)

- The ```Settings``` tab, enable the user to select models and to set the Openai API keys and other data sources API keys. Find more details about [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [data sources](https://github.com/Teakinboyewa/AutonomousGIS_GeodataRetrieverAgent/blob/master/User_manual.md#data-sources)

![PluginSetting.png](Docs%2FPluginSetting.png)

Note: API keys input here will only be stored locally on the user's computer ('plugin_dir/LLM-Find/config.ini').  

# Data Request Instructions

To make a data request, follow these steps:
- In the ```Data Request Message Panel```, type your data request using natural language.
- Specify the directory where you want the downloaded data to be saved.
- Enter your OpenAI API key and any other data source keys if required. Note: These API keys will be saved automatically in the ```config.ini``` file and will be used for any future data requests after this initial input.
- On the ```Data Request Page```, click the Send button to submit your request. Note: For the first request, it may take a minute to establish a connection to the OpenAI server.
- To stop a request, use the ```Interrupt``` button. This button is especially useful if you need to terminate a request. Additionally, the ```Clear``` button can be used to clear the code pad panel if needed.
