# Data request Instructions

To make a data request, follow these steps:
- In the ```Data Request Message Panel```, type your data request using natural language.
- Specify the directory where you want the downloaded data to be saved.
- Enter your OpenAI API key and any other data source keys if required. Note: These API keys will be saved automatically in the ```config.ini``` file and will be used for any future data requests after this initial input.
- On the ```Data Request Page```, click the Send button to submit your request. Note: For the first request, it may take a minute to establish a connection to the OpenAI server.
- To stop a request, use the ```Interrupt``` button. This button is especially useful if you need to terminate a request. Additionally, the ```Clear``` button can be used to clear the code pad panel if needed.
